package foresight.util

/**
 * Provides utility classes and methods for random number generation, discrete probability distributions and
 * probabilistic sampling.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Weighted random sampling, implemented in [[Sample]]
 * - Support for reproducible random number generation with [[Random]]
 * - [[DiscreteDistribution]] for representing and sampling from discrete probability distributions
 *
 * Typical use cases include selecting random subsets from collections, implementing randomized algorithms,
 * simulating probabilistic processes, and working with discrete probability distributions.
