/**
 * An e-graph is a data structure for representing and maintaining equivalence classes of expressions.
 * E-graphs support equality saturation, a powerful technique for exploring all equivalent forms of a term
 * by exhaustively applying rewrite rules while avoiding redundant work by compacting equivalent subterms
 * into shared e-classes.
 *
 * In Foresight, an e-graph contains:
 *  - **E-classes** ([[EClassRef]]/[[EClassCall]]): partitions of semantically equivalent expressions.
 *  - **E-nodes** ([[ENode]]): operator/operand tuples representing a single application of a function or constructor.
 *  - A **canonicalization invariant**: every e-class has a unique, canonical representative, and all queries
 *    and updates are expressed in terms of these canonical forms.
 *
 * ## Purpose of this trait
 * [[EGraphLike]] defines the core API contract for e-graph implementations, parameterized by:
 *  - The node payload type `NodeT` (the domain-specific symbol type your e-nodes use).
 *  - The self-type `This`, so all operations that conceptually return "the same kind of e-graph"
 *    return your most-derived type, preserving fluent, type-safe chaining.
 *
 * This trait is deliberately minimal but powerful:
 *  - **Query methods**: enumerate classes, retrieve nodes, check membership, canonicalize, resolve usage.
 *  - **Construction methods**: add nodes and trees, bulk-add, merge e-classes (union), or create an empty graph.
 *  - **Traversal methods**: find the e-class containing a given node or tree.
 *
 * Concrete e-graph variants (e.g., with metadata, recorded rule applications, or deferred unions) are built by
 * wrapping or extending a base [[EGraphLike]] implementation.
 *
 * ## Immutability and functional style
 * All e-graph operations return a **new** e-graph instance rather than mutating the receiver. This makes
 * e-graphs:
 *   - **Thread-safe by default** for read operations
 *   - Naturally suited to speculative or branch-and-bound rewriting, where multiple alternate states can
 *     be explored in parallel without interfering with each other
 *
 * As a consequence:
 *   - Adding nodes or merging classes returns a *new* `This` instance with the updated structure.
 *   - Query methods never modify the e-graph.
 *
 * ## Canonicalization
 * Canonicalization is central to e-graph correctness and performance:
 *   - Every e-class is identified by a canonical [[EClassRef]] (chosen representative).
 *   - When adding or merging, all inputs are canonicalized so that the same equivalence is not represented twice.
 *   - Queries that take non-canonical inputs will internally canonicalize them.
 *
 * ## Related types
 *   - [[EGraph]] — a simpler, single-parameter variant of this trait.
 *   - [[foresight.eqsat.metadata.EGraphWithMetadata]] — an [[EGraphLike]] augmented with per-class metadata storage.
 *   - [[EGraphWithPendingUnions]] — a deferred-union wrapper for batching merges before a rebuild.
 *   - [[ENode]], [[EClassRef]], [[EClassCall]], [[ShapeCall]] — fundamental building blocks.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The type of the domain-specific symbol or operator stored in each e-node.
 * @tparam This  The concrete e-graph type mixing in this trait, enabling precise return types for fluent APIs.
 * @example Typical usage
 * {{{
 * val (classA, g1) = egraph.add(nodeA)
 * val (classB, g2) = g1.add(nodeB)
 * val g3 = g2.union(classA, classB).rebuilt // merge equivalences
 * val allClasses: Iterable[EClassRef] = g3.classes
 * }}}
